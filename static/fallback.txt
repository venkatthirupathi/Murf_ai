This is a placeholder for the fallback.mp3 audio file.

To create a proper fallback audio file:
1. Record or generate a short audio message saying "I'm having trouble connecting right now."
2. Save it as "fallback.mp3" in this directory
3. Or update the fallback_tts function in services/tts.py to handle the case when Murf API is unavailable

The fallback audio will play when there are API errors or connection issues.
