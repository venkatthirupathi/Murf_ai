FALLBACK AUDIO FILE

To create a fallback audio file for when TTS fails:

1. Record a simple message like "I'm having trouble connecting right now" using any audio recording software
2. Save it as MP3 format
3. Rename it to "fallback.mp3" 
4. Place it in this static/ directory

Or use online TTS services like:
- Google Translate TTS
- Microsoft Edge Read Aloud
- Any text-to-speech converter

The file should be named "fallback.mp3" and placed in the static/ folder.
