FALLBACK AUDIO FILE INSTRUCTIONS

To fix the "Failed to generate audio" error, you need to create a fallback.mp3 file:

1. **Record Audio:**
   - Use your phone or computer to record: "I'm having trouble connecting right now"
   - Save as MP3 format

2. **Or Use Online TTS:**
   - Go to https://translate.google.com
   - Type: "I'm having trouble connecting right now"
   - Click the speaker icon to play
   - Use screen recording software to capture the audio
   - Save as MP3

3. **Place the file:**
   - Rename it to "fallback.mp3"
   - Put it in this static/ folder
   - The app will use it when TTS fails

4. **Alternative:**
   - Use any text-to-speech service
   - Generate the same message
   - Save as MP3

This will fix the audio generation errors!
